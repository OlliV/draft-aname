# draft-aname
work on a draft to standardize ANAME/ALIAS records to allow CNAME-like records at the zone apex

The draft text should be edited in "middle.mkd"; the abstract in
"abstract.mkd". The author info can be edited in "template.xml".

I'll periodically rebuild and update the txt and xml versions of the
draft using pandoc2rfc; those should not be edited here.
