<t>
  This document proposes a new DNS RR type ANAME, which provides similar
  functionality to CNAME but is specific to address queries (type A and
  AAAA), and can coexist with other record types at a zone apex. This
  allows zone owners to redirect queries for apex domain names without
  violating specifications that require CNAME not to coexist with other
  RR types such as NS and SOA.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
  
  <t>
    Websites hosted by content distribution networks are often served by
    multiple IP addresses handling different geographic areas. In some
    cases, the initial query for a domain name returns a CNAME record
    whose &lt;target&gt; is a name served by the CDN, which ultimately
    resolves to a different answer depending on the client's address.
  </t>
  <t>
    This method works with ordinary DNS nodes (for example,
    "www.example.com") but fails at zone apex nodes (such as
    "example.com"), because CNAME records are forbidden by
    <xref target="RFC1033"/> and <xref target="RFC1034"/>
    to coexist with other RR types such as SOA, NS, DNSKEY, MX, TXT/SPF,
    etc. (<xref target="RFC4034"/> specifies exceptions for some
    RR types such as NSEC and RRSIG, which are automatically returned
    alongside CNAME responses and are not generally queried for
    directly. Such exceptions are not realistic for most other query
    types; if a recursive resolver with a cached CNAME received a query
    for MX or DNSKEY, it would follow the CNAME, and would not find the
    correct answer.)
  </t>
  <t>
    This document proposes a new RR type "ANAME", which
    provides similar functionality to CNAME but only for address queries
    (type A and AAAA). The ANAME record can be present at any DNS node,
    and can coexist with other RR types at a zone apex.
  </t>
  <section title="Reserved Words" anchor="reserved-words">
    
    <t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
      "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
      "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
    </t>
  </section>
</section>
<section title="The ANAME RR Type" anchor="the-aname-rr-type">
  
  <t>
    This document specifies a new DNS resource record type ANAME, with
    RR code point [TBD]. The presentation format is identical to that of
    CNAME <xref target="RFC1033"/>. The wire format is also
    identical to CNAME, except that name compression is not permitted in
    ANAME RDATA per <xref target="RFC3597"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    No more than one ANAME resource record can be present at any DNS
    node.
  </t>
</section>
<section title="Authoritative Server Behavior" anchor="authoritative-server-behavior">
  
  <t>
    When an ANAME record is present at a DNS node and a query is
    received by an authoritative server for type A or AAAA, the
    authoritative server returns the ANAME RRset in the answer section.
    For the benefit of querying resolvers that do not implement ANAME,
    the authoritative server also returns address records as described
    below. (This is similar to the synthesized CNAME record included
    with DNAME <xref target="RFC6672"/>.)
  </t>
  <section title="Address records returned with ANAME" anchor="address-records-returned-with-aname">
    
    <t>
      If the original query is for type A, and an A RRset exists at the
      ANAME &lt;target&gt;, then that A RRset (with &lt;owner&gt;
      changed to match that of the ANAME RR), MUST be appended to the
      answer section after the ANAME RRset. If an AAAA RRset eixsts at
      the ANAME &lt;target&gt;, then it MAY be appended to the
      additional section (again, with &lt;owner&gt; changed to match
      that of the ANAME RR).
    </t>
    <t>
      Similarly, if the original query was for type AAAA, and an AAAA
      RRset exists at the ANAME &lt;target&gt;, then it is appended to
      the answer section, and if an A RRset also exists at the ANAME
      &lt;target&gt; then it MAY be appended to the additional section.
    </t>
    <t>
      How and when an authoritative server resolves the A and AAAA
      responses from the ANAME &lt;target&gt; (when it is not itself
      authoritative for &lt;target&gt;) is unspecified. If an
      authoritative server is capable of recursion, then it MAY perform
      recursion itself, or it MAY send A and AAAA queries to an external
      resolver. It MAY resolve A and AAAA when loading the zone and
      cache the responses (in which case it MUST periodically refresh
      them when their TTLs expire), or it MAY delay resolution of the A
      and AAAA at the ANAME &lt;target&gt; until an address query is
      received for the ANAME &lt;owner&gt;. (In either case, for
      peformance reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the authoritative
      server cache the A and AAAA responses.)
    </t>
    <t>
      If the original query is for type ANAME, A and AAAA records MAY be
      returned in the additional section.
    </t>
    <t>
      The TTL for the A and/or AAAA RRsets MUST be set to the lesser of
      the ANAME TTL and the TTL of the A and/or AAAA RRsets at the ANAME
      &lt;target&gt;. The TTL of cached A and/or AAAA RRsets MUST count
      down, just as they do in a resolver cache.
    </t>
    <t>
      If an A or AAAA RRset is included in the answer section which was
      resolved from a source for which the server is not authoritative,
      then the AA ("authoritative answer") bit in the DNS
      response header MUST be clear.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Coexistence with other types" anchor="coexistence-with-other-types">
    
    <t>
      If the zone is configured with an A RRset with the same owner as
      ANAME, then the ANAME MUST NOT be returned for queries of type A.
    </t>
    <t>
      Similarly, if ANAME coexists with AAAA, then ANAME MUST NOT be
      returned for queries of type AAAA.
    </t>
    <t>
      If ANAME coexists with both A and AAAA RRsets, then ANAME MUST NOT
      be returned under any circumstances. If a zone is configured with
      all three of ANAME, A, and AAAA at the same node, the server MAY
      treat this as an error condition and reject the zone.
    </t>
    <t>
      ANAME MUST NOT coexist with CNAME, or any other RR type that
      restricts the types with which it can itself coexist.
    </t>
    <t>
      ANAME can freely coexist at the same owner name with any other RR
      type.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="DNSSEC signing" anchor="dnssec-signing">
    
    <t>
      If the zone is DNSSEC signed, and if the server has access to the
      private key, then the A and AAAA RRsets SHOULD be signed, either
      in advance when populating the A/AAAA answers for ANAME records,
      or "on the fly" when responding to a query.
    </t>
    <t>
      Note that validating resolvers which do not yet implement ANAME
      will not be able to validate the A and AAAA responses included
      with an ANAME response, unless those responses are validly signed
      by a DNSKEY at the apex of the zone in which the ANAME resides.
      Passing along the RRSIGs associated with the original A and AAAA
      RRsets from the ANAME &lt;target&gt; will not be sufficient for
      DNSSEC validation.
    </t>
    <t>
      This implies that any authoritative server providing ANAME
      responses in a signed zone MUST have access to the zone signing
      key for that zone.
    </t>
    <t>
      Deployment of ANAME in signed zones where the private key is not
      accessible to the server is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED.
    </t>
  </section>
</section>
<section title="Recursive Server Behavior" anchor="recursive-server-behavior">
  
  <t>
    When a recursive resolver sends a query of type A or AAAA and
    receives a response with an ANAME RRset in the answer section, it
    MUST re-query for the ANAME &lt;target&gt;, disregarding any
    addresses that were included with the response. This is necessary
    because, in some cases, the final address will be dependent on
    network topology and other considerations, and the resolver will
    find a different answer than the authoritative server did. If
    configured to do so, the resolver MAY include an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET
    option when re-querying for the ANAME &lt;target&gt; and cache the
    response accordingly (see <xref target="RFC7871"/>).
  </t>
</section>
<section title="Operational Considerations" anchor="operational-considerations">
  
  <t>
    When a zone containing ANAME records is transferred to a secondary
    server, the ANAME records are transferred but the A or AAAA records
    retrieved from the ANAME &lt;target&gt; are not. If the primary
    server implements ANAME but the secondary server does not, then the
    two will return different answers for address queries. It is
    therefore recommended that ANAME not be deployed in a zone unless
    all of the authoritative servers for that zone implement ANAME.
  </t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security-considerations">
  
  <t>
    An authoritative server which implements ANAME must resolve address
    queries on behalf its clients, either internally or by querying an
    external resolver. Resolution takes place regardless of whether the
    client would ordinaily be permitted by local policy to send
    recursive queries.
  </t>
  <t>
    When a resolver that does not understand ANAME receives a response
    containing A or AAAA records with &lt;owner&gt; rewritten to match
    that of the ANAME RR, this may bypass security based on local policy
    limiting access to the original ANAME &lt;target&gt;.
  </t>
  <t>
    A validating resolver that does not understand ANAME will not be
    able to validate A and AAAA records unless they are signed.
  </t>

    type.
