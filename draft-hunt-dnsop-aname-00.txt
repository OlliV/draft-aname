             Address-specific DNS Name Redirection (ANAME)
                       draft-hunt-dnsop-aname-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a new DNS RR type ANAME, which provides
   similar functionality to CNAME but is specific to address queries
   (type A and AAAA), and can coexist with other record types.  This
   allows zone owners to redirect queries for apex domain names without
   violating specifications that require CNAME not to coexist with other
   RR types such as NS and SOA.

1.  Introduction

   Websites hosted by content distribution networks are often served by
   multiple IP addresses handling different geographic areas.  In many
   cases, an initial query for a domain name returns a CNAME record
   whose <target> is a name served by the CDN, and which ultimately
   resolves to a different final answer depending on the client's IP
   address or subnet, geographic location, or other considerations.

   It is common practice for sites to publish content at the second-
   level domain name (sometimes referred to as a "bare domain" or "zone
   apex": for example, "example.com" rather than "www.example.com").
   However, [RFC1033] forbids the use of CNAME records at the same node
   as any other record type.  Zone apex nodes always contain SOA and NS
   RRsets records, and frequently contain other types such as DNSKEY,
   MX, TXT/SPF, etc.  Consequently, CNAME is impermissible at apex
   nodes.

   It should be noted that [RFC4034] relaxed this restriction by
   allowing coexistence between CNAME and RRSIG and NSEC records, but
   such exceptions are not applicable to other resource records.  RRSIG
   and NSEC exist to prove the integrity of the CNAME record; they are
   not intended to associate arbitrary data with the domain name.

   DNAME [RFC6672] is also not a solution, as its function is to
   redirect all names in the namespace below the DNAME <owner>, not the
   DNAME <owner> itself.

   Redirecting website lookups to an alternate domain name via SRV or
   URI resource records would be an effective solution, but to date this
   approach has not been accepted by browser implementations.

   As a result of the above, the only widely supported and standards-
   compliant way to publish content at a zone apex is to to place A and/
   or AAAA records at that node.  THe flexibility afforded by CNAME is
   not available.

   This document proposes a new RR type "ANAME", which provides similar
   functionality to CNAME, but only for address queries (i.e., for type
   A or AAAA).  The ANAME record can be present at any DNS node, and can
   coexist with most other RR types, enabling it to be present at a zone
   apex.  Authoritative servers configured with ANAME records will
   answer address queries for the ANAME owner with addresses found at
   the ANAME's target, and also with the ANAME itself.  Recursive
   resolvers which understand ANAME can re-query for the ANAME target,
   just as if they had received a CNAME response.

1.1.  Terminology

   "Address type" refers to a DNS RR type that encodes a network
   address.  Currently the set of address types consists of A and AAAA.

   "Address query" refers to a DNS query for any address type.

1.2.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The ANAME Resource Record

   This document specifies a new DNS resource record type ANAME, with RR
   code point [TBD].

   The ANAME presentation format is identical to that of CNAME
   [RFC1033]:

       owner ttl class ANAME target

   The wire format is also identical to CNAME, except that name
   compression is not permitted in ANAME RDATA, per [RFC3597].

   No more than one ANAME resource record can be present at any DNS
   node.

3.  Authoritative Server Behavior

   When an ANAME record is present at a DNS node and a query is received
   by an authoritative server for type A or AAAA, the authoritative
   server returns the ANAME RRset in the answer section.

   For the benefit of querying resolvers that do not implement ANAME,
   the authoritative server also returns address records as described
   below.  (This is similar to the synthesized CNAME record included
   with DNAME [RFC6672].)

   Authoritative servers implementing ANAME MUST be equipped resolve the
   ANAME <target> on the querying resolver's behalf, either by sending
   queries to an external recursive resolver, or by implementing
   recursive resolution logic internally.

   If the ANAME <target> returns a chaining response (i.e., CNAME or
   DNAME), then the authoritative server MUST follow it until it is able
   to resolve an address response.

3.1.  Address records returned with ANAME

   If the original query is for type A, and an RRset of type A exists at
   the ANAME <target>, then that A RRset (with <owner> changed to match
   that of the ANAME RR), MUST be appended to the answer section after
   the ANAME RRset.  If an AAAA RRset is also known to exist at the
   ANAME <target>, then the AAAA RRset MAY be appended to the additional
   section (again, with <owner> changed to match that of the ANAME RR).

   Similarly, if the original query was for type AAAA, and an AAAA RRset
   exists at the ANAME <target>, then it is appended to the answer
   section, and if an A RRset also exists at the ANAME <target> then it
   MAY be appended to the additional section.

   If the original query is for type ANAME, A and AAAA records MAY be
   returned in the additional section.

   How and when an authoritative server resolves the A and AAAA
   responses from the ANAME <target> (when it is not itself
   authoritative for <target>) is unspecified.  If the authoritative
   server is capable of performing recursive resolution, then it MAY
   resolve the query itself, or it MAY send address queries to an
   external resolver.  It MAY send address queries to the ANAME <target>
   when loading the zone and store the responses locally, or it MAY
   delay resolution of the address records until a query is received for

   the ANAME <owner>.  In either case, for performance reasons, it is
   RECOMMENDED that address records be cached locally by the
   authoritative server.

   Address records cached locally MUST have a limited TTL.  The initial
   TTL for locally-cached address records MUST be set to the lesser of
   the ANAME TTL and the TTL of the address records retrieved from the
   ANAME <target>.  The local TTL MUST count down, just as it would in a
   conventional resolver cache.  Records with an expired TTL MUST NOT be
   returned until refreshed with a new query to the ANAME <target>.

   If configured to do so, then the authoritative server MAY, when
   sending queries to the ANAME <target>, include an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET
   (ECS) option [RFC7871], either forwarding an ECS option that was sent
   to it by the querying resolver, or generating a new ECS option from
   the querying resolver's address.  If a response from the ANAME
   <target> includes an ECS option with a SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH greater
   than zero, the response SHOULD be cached with the ECS data and should
   only be used in response to queries from the same client subnet.

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: Some suggestions have been made about
   signaling ANAME capability via an EDNS option.  If a query indicated
   that the client understood ANAME, then the authority could respond
   differently.  This may turn out to be necessary, but I want to hold
   off on specifying it until we're sure that it is. - each]

3.2.  Coexistence with other types

   If the zone is configured with an A RRset with the same owner as
   ANAME, then the ANAME MUST NOT be returned for queries of type A.

   Similarly, if ANAME coexists with AAAA, then ANAME MUST NOT be
   returned for queries of type AAAA.

   If ANAME coexists with both A and AAAA RRsets, then the ANAME MUST
   NOT be returned under any circumstances.  If a zone is configured
   with all three of ANAME, A, and AAAA at the same node, the server MAY
   treat this as an error condition and reject the zone.

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: I wrote the above thinking that someone
   might want to use ANAME for A or AAAA but not both.  Existing
   implementations apparently handle coexistence with A and AAAA
   differently.  Some simply add the locally defined A/AAAA to the
   expanded ANAME response.  A suggestion has been made that this could
   be used as a fallback in the event of resolution failure, or a
   suggestion about address preference.  We'll need to settle this.  -

   ANAME MUST NOT coexist with CNAME, or any other RR type that
   restricts the types with which it can itself coexist.

   ANAME can freely coexist at the same owner name with any other RR
   type.

3.3.  DNSSEC signing

   If the zone is DNSSEC signed, and if the server has access to the
   private key, then the A and AAAA RRsets SHOULD be signed, either in
   advance when populating the A/AAAA answers for ANAME records, or "on
   the fly" when responding to a query.

   Validating resolvers which do not yet implement ANAME will not be
   able to validate the A and AAAA responses included with an ANAME
   response, unless those responses are validly signed by a DNSKEY at
   the apex of the zone in which the ANAME resides.  Passing along the
   RRSIGs associated with the original A and AAAA RRsets from the ANAME
   <target> will not be sufficient for DNSSEC validation.

   This implies that every authoritative server providing ANAME
   responses in a signed zone MUST have access to the zone signing key
   for that zone.  Deployment of ANAME in signed zones where the private
   key is not accessible to all authoritative servers is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

   When ANAME is present in a signed DNS node, the type bit map in the
   NSEC [RFC4034] or NSEC3 [RFC5155] record for that node MUST include
   at least one of A and AAAA as well as ANAME.  This is for the benefit
   of validating resolvers not implementing ANAME which may use a signed
   proof of nonexistence for type A and AAAA to prevent address queries
   from being resolved.  The type bit map SHOULD only include address
   types which are known to exist at the ANAME <target>.

4.  Recursive Server Behavior

   When a recursive resolver sends a query of type A or AAAA and
   receives a response with an ANAME RRset in the answer section, it
   MUST re-query for the ANAME <target>, disregarding any addresses that
   were included with the response.  This is necessary because, in some
   cases, the address received will be dependent on network topology and
   other considerations, and the resolver will find a different answer
   than the authoritative server did.

   If configured to do so, the resolver MAY include an EDNS CLIENT-
   SUBNET option when re-querying for the ANAME <target> and cache the
   response accordingly (see [RFC7871]).

5.  Operational Considerations

   When a zone containing ANAME records is transferred to a secondary
   server, the ANAME records are transferred, but the A or AAAA records
   retrieved from the ANAME <target> are not.  If the primary server
   implements ANAME but the secondary server does not, then the two will
   return different answers for address queries.  It is therefore
   RECOMMENDED that ANAME not be deployed in a zone unless all of the
   authoritative servers for that zone implement ANAME.

6.  Security Considerations

   An authoritative server which implements ANAME must resolve address
   queries on behalf its clients, either internally or by querying an
   external resolver.  This resolution must be allowed to take place
   regardless of whether the client would ordinaily have been permitted
   by local policy to send recursive queries.

   When a resolver that does not understand ANAME receives a response
   containing A or AAAA records with <owner> rewritten to match that of
   the ANAME RR, this may bypass security mechanisms based on local
   policy limiting access to the original ANAME <target>.

   A validating resolver that does not understand ANAME will not be able
   to validate A and AAAA records unless they are signed.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a DNS RR type code for the ANAME RR
   type.
