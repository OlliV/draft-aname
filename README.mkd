# draft-aname
work on a draft to standardize ANAME/ALIAS records to allow CNAME-like records at the zone apex

The draft text should be edited in "middle.mkd". The abstract and author
info can also be edited in "template.xml". I'll periodically rebuild
and update the txt and xml versions of the draft using pandoc2rfc; those
should not be edited here.
