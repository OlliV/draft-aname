This document defines the "ANAME" DNS RR type, to provide similar
functionality to CNAME, but limited to type A and AAAA address queries.
Unlike CNAME, an ANAME can coexist with other record types.
The ANAME RR type allows zone owners to redirect queries for apex domain
names in a standards compliant manner.
