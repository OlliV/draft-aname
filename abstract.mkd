This document proposes a new DNS RR type ANAME, which provides
similar functionality to CNAME but is specific to address queries (type A
and AAAA), and can coexist with other record types.  This allows zone
owners to redirect queries for apex domain names without violating
specifications that require CNAME not to coexist with other RR types such
as NS and SOA.
