             Address-specific DNS Name Redirection (ANAME)
                       draft-hunt-dnsop-aname-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a new DNS RR type ANAME, which provides
   similar functionality to CNAME but is specific to address queries
   (type A and AAAA), and can coexist with other record types at a zone
   apex.  This allows zone owners to redirect queries for apex domain
   names without violating specifications that require CNAME not to
   coexist with other RR types such as NS and SOA.

1.  Introduction

   Websites hosted by content distribution networks are often served by
   multiple IP addresses handling different geographic areas.  In many
   cases, an initial query for a domain name returns a CNAME record
   whose <target> is a name served by the CDN, and which ultimately
   resolves to a different final answer depending on the client's IP
   address or subnet, geographic location, or other considerations.

   It is common practice for sites to publish content at the second-
   level domain name (sometimes referred to as a "bare domain" or "zone
   apex": for example, "example.com" rather than "www.example.com").
   However, [RFC1033] forbids the use of CNAME records at the same node
   as any other record type.  Zone apex nodes always contain SOA and NS
   RRsets records, and frequently contain other types such as DNSKEY,
   MX, TXT/SPF, etc.  Consequently, CNAME is impermissible at apex
   nodes.

   (It should be noted that [RFC4034] relaxed this restriction by
   allowing coexistence between CNAME and RRSIG and NSEC records, but
   such exceptions are not realistic for other query types.  If, for
   example, a recursive resolver with a cached CNAME received a query
   for MX or DNSKEY, it would follow the CNAME, and would not find the
   correct answer.)

   As a result of the above, the only standards-compliant way to publish
   content there is to to use A and AAAA records in the apex node,
   limiting the flexibility afforded by CNAME.

   This document proposes a new RR type "ANAME", which provides similar
   functionality to CNAME, but only for address queries (type A and
   AAAA).  The ANAME record can be present at any DNS node, and can
   coexist with other RR types at a zone apex.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The ANAME Resource Record

   This document specifies a new DNS resource record type ANAME, with RR
   code point [TBD].

   The ANAME presentation format is identical to that of CNAME
   [RFC1033]:

       owner ttl class ANAME target

   The wire format is also identical to CNAME, except that name
   compression is not permitted in ANAME RDATA, per [RFC3597].

   No more than one ANAME resource record can be present at any DNS
   node.

3.  Authoritative Server Behavior

   When an ANAME record is present at a DNS node and a query is received
   by an authoritative server for type A or AAAA, the authoritative
   server returns the ANAME RRset in the answer section.  For the
   benefit of querying resolvers that do not implement ANAME, the
   authoritative server also returns address records as described below.
   (This is similar to the synthesized CNAME record included with DNAME
   [RFC6672].)

3.1.  Address records returned with ANAME

   If the original query is for type A, and an A RRset exists at the
   ANAME <target>, then that A RRset (with <owner> changed to match that
   of the ANAME RR), MUST be appended to the answer section after the
   ANAME RRset.  If an AAAA RRset eixsts at the ANAME <target>, then it




Hunt, et al.             Expires October 1, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    aname                       March 2017


   MAY be appended to the additional section (again, with <owner>
   changed to match that of the ANAME RR).

   Similarly, if the original query was for type AAAA, and an AAAA RRset
   exists at the ANAME <target>, then it is appended to the answer
   section, and if an A RRset also exists at the ANAME <target> then it
   MAY be appended to the additional section.

   How and when an authoritative server resolves the A and AAAA
   responses from the ANAME <target> (when it is not itself
   authoritative for <target>) is unspecified.  If an authoritative
   server is capable of recursion, then it MAY perform recursion itself,
   or it MAY send A and AAAA queries to an external resolver.  It MAY
   resolve A and AAAA when loading the zone and cache the responses (in
   which case it MUST periodically refresh them when their TTLs expire),
   or it MAY delay resolution of the A and AAAA at the ANAME <target>
   until an address query is received for the ANAME <owner>.  (In either
   case, for peformance reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   authoritative server cache the A and AAAA responses.)

   If the original query is for type ANAME, A and AAAA records MAY be
   returned in the additional section.

   The TTL for the A and/or AAAA RRsets MUST be set to the lesser of the
   ANAME TTL and the TTL of the A and/or AAAA RRsets at the ANAME
   <target>.  The TTL of cached A and/or AAAA RRsets MUST count down,
   just as they would do in a resolver cache.

   If an A or AAAA RRset is included in the answer section which was
   resolved from a source for which the server is not authoritative,
   then the AA ("authoritative answer") bit in the DNS response header
   MUST be clear.

3.2.  Coexistence with other types

   If the zone is configured with an A RRset with the same owner as
   ANAME, then the ANAME MUST NOT be returned for queries of type A.

   Similarly, if ANAME coexists with AAAA, then ANAME MUST NOT be
   returned for queries of type AAAA.

   If ANAME coexists with both A and AAAA RRsets, then the ANAME MUST
   NOT be returned under any circumstances.  If a zone is configured
   with all three of ANAME, A, and AAAA at the same node, the server MAY
   treat this as an error condition and reject the zone.

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: I wrote the above thinking that someone
   might want to use ANAME for A or AAAA but not both.  Existing

   implementations apparently handle coexistence with A and AAAA
   differently.  Some simply add the locally defined A/AAAA to the
   expanded ANAME response.  A suggestion has been made that this could
   be used as a fallback in the event of resolution failure, or a
   suggestion about address preference.  We'll need to settle this.  -
   each]

   ANAME MUST NOT coexist with CNAME, or any other RR type that
   restricts the types with which it can itself coexist.

   ANAME can freely coexist at the same owner name with any other RR
   type.

3.3.  DNSSEC signing

   If the zone is DNSSEC signed, and if the server has access to the
   private key, then the A and AAAA RRsets SHOULD be signed, either in
   advance when populating the A/AAAA answers for ANAME records, or "on
   the fly" when responding to a query.

   Validating resolvers which do not yet implement ANAME will not be
   able to validate the A and AAAA responses included with an ANAME
   response, unless those responses are validly signed by a DNSKEY at
   the apex of the zone in which the ANAME resides.  Passing along the
   RRSIGs associated with the original A and AAAA RRsets from the ANAME
   <target> will not be sufficient for DNSSEC validation.

   This implies that every authoritative server providing ANAME
   responses in a signed zone MUST have access to the zone signing key
   for that zone.

   Deployment of ANAME in signed zones where the private key is not
   accessible to all authoritative servers is NOT RECOMMENDED.

4.  Recursive Server Behavior

   When a recursive resolver sends a query of type A or AAAA and
   receives a response with an ANAME RRset in the answer section, it
   MUST re-query for the ANAME <target>, disregarding any addresses that
   were included with the response.  This is necessary because, in some
   cases, the address received will be dependent on network topology and
   other considerations, and the resolver will find a different answer
   than the authoritative server did.

   If configured to do so, the resolver MAY include an EDNS CLIENT-
   SUBNET option when re-querying for the ANAME <target> and cache the
   response accordingly (see [RFC7871]).

5.  Operational Considerations

   When a zone containing ANAME records is transferred to a secondary
   server, the ANAME records are transferred, but the A or AAAA records
   retrieved from the ANAME <target> are not.  If the primary server
   implements ANAME but the secondary server does not, then the two will
   return different answers for address queries.  It is therefore
   RECOMMENDED that ANAME not be deployed in a zone unless all of the
   authoritative servers for that zone implement ANAME.

6.  Security Considerations

   An authoritative server which implements ANAME must resolve address
   queries on behalf its clients, either internally or by querying an
   external resolver.  This resolution must be allowed to take place
   regardless of whether the client would ordinaily have been permitted
   by local policy to send recursive queries.

   When a resolver that does not understand ANAME receives a response
   containing A or AAAA records with <owner> rewritten to match that of
   the ANAME RR, this may bypass security mechanisms based on local
   policy limiting access to the original ANAME <target>.

   A validating resolver that does not understand ANAME will not be able
   to validate A and AAAA records unless they are signed.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a DNS RR type code for the ANAME RR
   type.
